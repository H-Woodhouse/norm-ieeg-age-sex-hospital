# Folder structure

__1_data__ comprises the final normative data frames ready for modelling. There is:
- Details on the scale 36 parcellation ('ROI1'), inc. names, labels, xyz coords, hemisphere, cortical
- A df with Subj ID / Hospital / Age / Age_onset / Sex / ROI / RBP in five freq. bands, for ROI1
- The same ROI1 RBP table with symmetric regions mirrored
- The number of hospitals per region in the mirrored ROI1 RBP data
- The number of subjects per region in the mirrored ROI1 RBP data

__2_analysis__ contains all modelling and plotting scripts, organised in the order they appear in the manuscript.

__3_outputs__ and __4_supplementary__ are not tracked. The former is created within scripts and any output produced is stored there.

__MATLAB_lib__ folder has the functions called to plot the brains along with the pial files needed.
